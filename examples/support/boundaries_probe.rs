//! Finding the frames on a strip, from a thumbnail of it
//!
//! 2-11-6 leaves this to the host: the unit takes one pass over everything
//! loaded and expects a table of rectangles back.
//!
//! Brightness cannot tell a frame from the film between two frames. Unexposed
//! slide is as dark as a shadow, and the holder and the bare gate are the
//! extremes of the whole pass. What does separate them is that unexposed film
//! is even down the sensor and a picture is not, so a column is scored on how
//! much it varies. A flat picture needs the film type as well: that says which
//! side of the unexposed level a picture lies.
//!
//! Frames are then placed by tiling the whole strip at once rather than by
//! picking edges one at a time, so a strip that under-advanced comes back with
//! frames that overlap and the film they share in both.
//!
//! The frame length is the caller's: with a few frames on a strip the holder
//! and backlight edges dominate any autocorrelation, so it cannot be measured.
//!
//! Ratios and logarithms throughout, so floats here where the rest of the pass
//! handling is samples.
//!
//! Thanks to @toesoe, who worked out that a collapsed thumbnail is all this
//! takes.
